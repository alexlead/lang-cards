# Language Cards 

## Description
This application is designed to assist in language learning. It allows you to create flashcards for vocabulary study and test your knowledge.
The application utilizes browser technologies (IndexDB), so it doesnâ€™t require server access or user authentication. However, this also means that you cannot access your collections from other devices, as collections are stored locally on your device. If you want to use the application on another device, you'll need to recreate your collections there.

## Technologies
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- IndexDB API
